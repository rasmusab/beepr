\title{Easily Play Notification Sounds on any Platform}
\description{
This package contains one function, beep(), with one purpose: To make it easy
to play notification sounds on whatever platform you are on. It is intended to
be useful, for example, if you are running a long analysis in the background
and want to know when it is ready.
}
\details{
The package contains one main function \code{\link{beep}}, check it out to 
see what it does. For sound on Windows and MacOS \pkg{beepr} depends on the 
\pkg{audio} package. For sound on Linux \pkg{beepr} depends on that either
the paplay utility from the Pulse Audio system, the aplay utility from the
ALSA system, or VLC media player (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) is
installed and on the PATH. Chances are that you already have one of these.
